# Target Score Prediction in the game of Cricket

This is a project submitted as part of CS 7641 - Machine Learning course - (Grad). The project explores the use of machine learning
techniques to try and predict the target scores in rain interrupted matches in the game of cricket. Typical approaches used for the same mostly rely on heuristics. Our aim is to incorporate learning algorithms to do this.

Abstract:
There has been a recent increase in the use of technology in sports to increase the fairness of the results. The objective of this paper is to apply machine learning techniques to the game of cricket for target prediction in case of interruption to the game. We first evaluate and identify some of the shortcomings of the predominantly used Duckworth - Lewis method (D/L) for target prediction. The data for this was obtained by crawling websites which maintain statistics of cricket matches in the past and selected a set of features which are most likely to affect the outcome of the game. Then, we ran feature estimation algorithms to identify the important features that help in target prediction. Then we discuss how the some of the shortcomings of D/L method can be overcome with Machine Learning ideas. Then we discuss Regression type algorithms which perform as well as D/L method but also take into consideration some of the features that D/L overlooks. Then we provide a framework to compare the target prediction algorithms with one another. Finally we discuss the results of the Machine Learning algorithm against benchmarks and ways to enhance the prediction models.
